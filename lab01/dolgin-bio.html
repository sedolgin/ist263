    Sarah Dolgin<br>

    I am a senior dual major in newspaper and online journalism and information management and technology with a concentration in data analytics.<br> I am interested in merging my passion for reporting with my knack for data exploration to tell comprehensive stories about the world.<br>

    I have experience interning and freelancing with different kinds of professional media publications — from small nonprofit newsrooms to statewide outlets.<br> I am also the executive editor of the premiere student-run arts and culture magazine on campus and spend time working on the communication school’s in-house digital news site as the special projects lead producer.<br> 

    I absolutely adore my pet rabbit Bean and like to run outside in my free time.<br> When visiting my hometown in the suburbs outside of New York City, I pick up shifts for the small independent bookstore I spent countless hours working at throughout high school.
