    <div><p>
        I loved journalism before I could properly comprehend the term and am working to build a future doing what I love.<br>
        <br>
        I am graduating from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University in May with a dual degree in newspaper and online journalism, and information management and technology with a concentration in data analytics.<br> 
        <br>
        I am the executive editor of <i>Jerk Magazine</i>, the premiere student-run arts and culture magazine, and work as the special projects lead producer for <i>The NewsHouse</i>, the communication school’s digital news site. The past two years marked a transition from my experience in news writing and gave me the opportunity to focus on mentoring underclassmen in the journalism school and polishing my skills in SEO and data visualization.<br> 
        <br>
        Outside of school, I can be found in downtown Syracuse interning at <i>Central Current</i>, a startup nonprofit newsroom focused on highlighting local voices. Additionally, I love to freelance and take on everything from newsletter articles to tributes and feature pieces. I aspire to combine my data and reporting skills to enter a full-time position at which I can work on enterprise and solutions-oriented projects.</p></div>
