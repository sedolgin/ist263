    <h2>Personal info</h2>
    
    <p>I absolutely adore my pet rabbit <strong>Bean</strong> and like to run outside in my free time.When visiting my hometown in the suburbs outside of New York City, I pick up shifts for the small independent bookstore I spent countless hours working at throughout high school.</p> 

    <p>Before I leave Syracuse University, I hope to:</p>
